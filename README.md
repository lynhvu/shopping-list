## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to the shopping list by entering the item name and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key. New items are dynamically added to the list.
- **Edit Items**: Users can edit existing items on the shopping list by clicking on the item and modifying its name inline. The changes are automatically saved and reflected in the list.
- **Remove Items**: Each item on the list has a delete button that allows users to remove items they no longer need. Clicking the delete button removes the item from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: The shopping list utilizes the browser's local storage to store the list of items. This ensures that the list remains intact even after the page is refreshed or reopened. The stored items are loaded when the page is revisited.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The project's functionality is implemented using JavaScript to handle user interactions, manage the shopping list, and interact with the browser's local storage.
- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the shopping list are created using HTML, providing a foundation for the project.
- **CSS**: The project is styled using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and provide an intuitive user interface.
